Chess Game Milestone Project

Working to create a Chess Game for this program, due to the lack of time available to me due to my work schedule taking up most of my week, I was unable to get the game properly working. I was able to get the appearance of the board and the chess pieces, but could not get the pieces to work properly. I had to consult extra github repositories in order to get java to work. I tried to make the board as close as I could to a real life board, since I Felt that woulud allow it to have some identity. I wanted to get the game to register a move with a shaded effect. I wanted to change the colors for the pieces but figured that would take too long to get done. I was able to get a restart button to appear in the form of new game, but could not get it to function.
