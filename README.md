Chess Game Milestone Project

Working to create a Chess Game for this program, due to the lack of time available to me due to my work schedule taking up most of my week, I was unable to get the game properly working. I was able to get the appearance of the board and the chess pieces, but could not get the pieces to work properly. I had to consult extra github repositories and YouTube videos in order to get java to work. I tried to make the board as close as I could to a real life board, since I Felt that would allow it to have some identity. I wanted to get the game to register a move with a shaded effect. I wanted to change the colors for the pieces but figured that would take too long to get done. I was able to get a restart button to appear in the form of new game, but could not get it to function.

Thought Process:
HTML: To give a basic form and shape to the website
CSS: To Give the board and webpage more color and match the theme
Java: To interact with the game and follow the chess rules


Controls:
 Suppose to use mouse button to interact with the game, and switch with another person in the room.

 Goals:
 Get the pieces to move after a highlighted click

 Used:
 VScode (HTML, CSS, JS)
 Canvas activities to reference Git steps and other forgotten tips
 Royalty free chess pieces
 Various Youtube videos and GitHub repositories to get scripts to run
 Dolphins Hex Code: https://teamcolorcodes.com/miami-dolphins-color-codes/ & https://sportsfancovers.com/nfl-team-colors/miami-dolphins-team-colors/
